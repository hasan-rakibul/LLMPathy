# Some of the important configurations
- `config/config_common.yaml` primarily includes configs that are common across train and test.
     - The pre-trained model is to be specified here.
     - The name of the columns to be supplied here to specify which one is LLM-generated and which one is the crowdsourced labels.

# Test
```bash
# configure the path in `config/config_test.yaml`
# e.g., set test_from_ckpts_parent_dir= logs/20241115_005338_y'(2024,2022)-ImprovedEarlyStop-MultiAlpha/lr_3e-05_bs_16/alpha_4.0`
# or test_from_checkpoint=/path/including/ckpt.ckpt
python src/test.py
```
- `job_test.sh` is a SLURM script, applicable for the Pawsey Setonix cluster.

# Notes
## Logging
- y(202x, ...): baeline with crowdsourced (CS) labels (Table II)
- y'(202x, ...): 1st application scenario, where labels are modified based on alpha.
- y_llm(202x, ...): 2nd application scenario, where labels generated by LLM are used.

At most cases, combination of the above scenarios are used.
- y(202x)+y_llm(202y): 2nd application scenario. E.g., `logs/20241230_095259_y(2022)-y_llm(2024)-gpt` means NewsEmp24 + GPT-labelled NewsEmp22 (Table III)
